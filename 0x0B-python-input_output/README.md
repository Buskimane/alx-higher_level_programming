# Python - Input/Output

In this project, I practiced file handling in Python. I used the builtin `with`,
`open`, and `read` functions with the `json` module to read and write files and
serialize and deserialize objects with JSON.
In this project I learnt to read/write files and working with json files in python

## Concepts learnt
- How to open a file
- How to write text in a file
- How to read the full content of a file
- How to read a file line by line
- How to move the cursor in a file
- How to make sure a file is closed after using it
- What is and how to use the with statement
- What is JSON
- What is serialization
- What is deserialization
- How to convert a Python data structure to a JSON string
- How to convert a JSON string to a Python data structure
